# RDGODE

## Overview

RDGODE is a Python-based framework that integrates Reaction-Diffusion Graph Convolutional Networks (RDGCN) with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) for modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics. This approach is particularly suited for applications involving reaction-diffusion systems and graph-structured data.
